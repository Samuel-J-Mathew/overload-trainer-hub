Build Functional Nutrition Page with Firebase Integration
Build out the full Nutrition Page in the Overload fitness coaching app with three interactive tabs and connected Firebase saving under each coach’s client.

🗂 Tabs to Include:
Plans

Meals

Foods

Use Tailwind CSS for styling and React component structure.

🔹 1. PLANS TAB
➕ “Add Plan” Button:
When clicked, show a form that asks for:

Plan Name (string)

Plan Description (multiline text)

Plan Type (dropdown):

Meal Plan

Total Macros

Macros by Meal

📋 Conditional Plan Type Forms:
🔸 Meal Plan
Allows the user to add multiple meals to the plan

Each meal includes:

Meal Name

Description

Meal Instructions

🔸 Total Macros
Allows user to enter overall daily targets:

Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fats

🔸 Macros by Meal
Allows user to add multiple meals, each with:

Meal Name

Notes

Protein, Carbs, Fats

🔥 Firebase Storage Path:
Each plan should be saved to:

bash
Copy
Edit
/coaches/{coachUID}/clients/{clientUID}/nutrition/plans/{planID}
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
/coaches/vy3MkwK49aUn1rugLhFJoPY4rR82/clients/5OhDAb13Yxa6nyI0qcUjjMjQvCu1/nutrition/plans/
Plan Document Structure:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  name: "Lean Bulk Plan",
  description: "Designed to build mass while staying lean.",
  type: "macrosByMeal" || "totalMacros" || "mealPlan",
  createdAt: serverTimestamp()
}
Subfields or arrays based on type:

For totalMacros:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  calories: 2400,
  protein: 180,
  carbs: 250,
  fats: 70
}
For macrosByMeal:

js
Copy
Edit
meals: [
  {
    name: "Lunch",
    notes: "High-carb, post-workout meal",
    protein: 40,
    carbs: 60,
    fats: 15
  },
  ...
]

js
Copy
Edit
meals: [
  {
    name: "Breakfast",
    description: "Oats and eggs",
    instructions: "Cook oats, scramble eggs..."
  },
  ...
]
🔹 2. MEALS TAB
(Structure it for standalone saved meals — not part of a plan)

Allow coaches to create, edit, and view standalone meals.

Each meal includes:

Meal Name

Description

Instructions

Firebase Path:

bash
Copy
Edit
/coaches/{coachUID}/clients/{clientUID}/nutrition/meals/{mealID}
🔹 3. FOODS TAB
Create a searchable list of foods the client has logged (if pulling from app data).

Pull from:

bash
Copy
Edit
/users/{clientUID}/foods/{date}/entries/
List each entry with:

Name

Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fats

Timestamp

(Optional) add filters by date or macros

🔧 Firebase SDK Notes:
Use setDoc, addDoc, collection, doc, serverTimestamp from Firebase Modular v9

Save under the full path:
/coaches/{coachUID}/clients/{clientUID}/nutrition/...

Use uuid or auto-generated IDs for new plans/meals/entries

✅ Make all UI reactive
✅ Use modals for adding meals or questions
✅ Automatically update lists after new entries are saved
✅ Match the dark theme/white contrast of the Overload UI
