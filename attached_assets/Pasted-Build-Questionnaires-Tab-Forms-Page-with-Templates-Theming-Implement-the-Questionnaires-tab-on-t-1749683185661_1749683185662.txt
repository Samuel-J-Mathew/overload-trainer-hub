Build Questionnaires Tab (Forms Page) with Templates + Theming
Implement the Questionnaires tab on the Forms Page for the Overload coaching dashboard. This should be very similar in structure and behavior to the Check-Ins tab, with some key additions:

🧩 UI Structure
✅ Two Tabs on Forms Page:

Check-Ins (already built)

Questionnaires (implement now)

📄 Questionnaires Tab Functionality
➕ “Add Questionnaire” Button
Clicking this opens a form to:

Input the Questionnaire name

After saving, a card appears showing the name

Clicking the card opens a blank Questionnaire Builder page

🧱 Questionnaire Builder View
Shows title of the questionnaire at the top

Has a button: "Add Question"

Clicking this opens a modal popup

Inputs:

Question Text

Type (dropdown: Text, Number, Yes/No, Scale, Star Rating, Progress Photos)

Required (checkbox)

Saved questions appear in a list underneath

🧰 Template System (next to "Add Questionnaire")
Add a “Template” button beside “Add Questionnaire”

Clicking it opens a black-themed modal popup

Inside the modal, show 3 prebuilt questionnaire templates:

1. Initial Assessment
A comprehensive form to understand your client's goals, habits, and preferences before coaching begins.

2. Health + Readiness Survey (PAR-Q)
A physical readiness questionnaire for identifying risks and screening medical concerns before starting a training program.

3. Feedback Survey
A form to gather client feedback on coaching progress, satisfaction, and improvement areas.

✅ Each template should display a brief description and a “Use Template” button
✅ When clicked, it should auto-create a questionnaire with all the corresponding questions

🗃️ Firebase Structure (same as Check-Ins, under coaches)
Save questionnaires under:

bash
Copy
Edit
/coaches/{coachUID}/forms/questionnaires/{questionnaireID}
Each questionnaire:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  formName: "Feedback Survey",
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp()
}
With nested subcollection:

bash
Copy
Edit
/coaches/{coachUID}/forms/questionnaires/{questionnaireID}/questions/{questionID}
Each question:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  questionText: "What are your fitness goals?",
  responseType: "text", // or number, yesNo, scale, star, progressPhoto
  required: true,
  order: 1
}
✅ Use Tailwind CSS
✅ The questionnaire templates modal must use a different theme — black background with clean white text for visual contrast
✅ Use modular components (e.g. QuestionnaireBuilder.jsx, AddQuestionModal.jsx, TemplateSelectorModal.jsx)
✅ Ensure newly added forms and templates display in the main questionnaire list

Let me know if you want to support editing, reordering, or deleting questions too.
