Build a modern and responsive web client for my fitness coaching app Overload. Use:

React (frontend framework)

Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)

Firebase (Firestore for data, Firebase Auth, and Firebase Storage)

This app should connect to my Firebase project and access real-time data from:

Client profiles

Workouts

Nutrition logs

Check-ins

Metrics (body fat %, weight, etc.)

Step counts

üåü Design Style:
Match the layout and UX of Hubfit (I'll upload screenshots). Use clean cards, tabs, and charts to organize data. Mobile responsiveness is required.

üß† Focus on the Clients Tab, with these sections:
1. Overview
Show profile image, name, current weight, goal weight, target body fat %

Display assigned workout split and next check-in date

Display current step count and weekly average steps (from Firebase)

2. Check-ins
Pull weekly check-ins including weight, progress photos, and written reflections

Allow expandable UI to view details

All check-ins are stored in Firestore under each user‚Äôs collection

3. Training
Show current training split

List recent workouts: exercises, sets, reps, weight, time

Pull from the workout_data collection

4. Nutrition
Show daily food logs with calories, protein, carbs, and fat

Pull from the FoodLogPage data

Include charts to visualize macro trends (last 7 days)

5. Metrics
Plot body fat %, weight, and calorie adherence over time

Display trend lines or bar charts using Chart.js or Recharts

6. Step Count (NEW)
Include a dedicated module or widget on Overview and Metrics

Show:

Today's step count

Weekly average

Step streaks (if possible)

Data comes from Firebase, stored as daily step entries

üîê Auth & Structure
Use Firebase Auth to restrict access

Modular React components per section

All data is stored in Firestore using a nested structure (e.g. users/{uid}/checkins, users/{uid}/workouts, etc.)

Use real-time listeners for up-to-date UI where needed

Focus on Clients tab first. Then allow easy expansion to other tabs like calendar, chat, or programs later.
